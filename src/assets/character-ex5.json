  "desc": "After receiving half of Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki's chakra, Sasuke awakened a Rinnegan in his left eye, with three tomoe on each of its two innermost circles. However, should Sasuke's chakra reserves fall to a certain level, the tomoe vanish and the Rinnegan takes on the commonly known appearance. Unlike his lower dōjutsu, Sasuke's Rinnegan is permanently active, apparently unable to revert to its original state. Despite this, it has no affect on his stamina or chakra levels. Likewise, Sasuke's Rinnegan can still access the techniques and abilities of his left Mangekyō Sharingan.",

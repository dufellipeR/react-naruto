  "desc": "With the power given to him by Hagoromo, Naruto gained access to the Six Paths Sage Mode (六道仙人モード, Rikudō Sennin Mōdo). In this mode, his pupils take on a cross-like shape — without manifesting the orange pigmentation around his eyes present in Sage Mode. Going further, Naruto donned a new Nine-Tails Chakra Mode cloak, which he could access instantly and maintain much longer than his standard Sage Mode. Naruto's physical attributes and techniques are further augmented, to the point where he could dodge attacks that moved at the speed of light and deflect Truth-Seeking Balls. It also empowers his sensory abilities to the highest possible level, which allowed him to sense the invisible shadows of Limbo.",
